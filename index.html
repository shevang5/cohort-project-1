    <p >Let's start with my morning. I woke up early and drink a 1liter water. Then, I decided to go roof and read a book called ALMANAK OF NAVAL RAVIKANT by ERIC JORGENSON. It was a beautiful sunny day, and the birds were singing. I saw many people walking their dogs and children playing. It was very refreshing.</p>
