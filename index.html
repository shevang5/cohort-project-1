          thoughts and experiences with you all. In this post. I will be talking

        </p>
<br>
        <p>
          Let's start with my morning. I woke up early and drink a 1liter water.
          Then, I decided to go roof and read a book called <i>ALMANAK OF NAVAL
            RAVIKANT</i> by <i>ERIC JORGENSON</i>. It was a beautiful sunny day, and the
          birds were singing. I saw many people walking their dogs and children
          playing. It was very refreshing.
